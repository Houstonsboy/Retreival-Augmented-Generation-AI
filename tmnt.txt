Following the death of the Super-Ras Al Ghul, Tiger Claw has led the unspecified Foot Cultists into obtaining the Scroll of the Demodragon and a special control amulet called the "Seal of the Ancients" that would enable him to summon the demodragon Kavaxas. When Kavaxas is summoned from the Netherworld, Tiger Claw plans to use Kavaxas' wish-granting abilities to revive the Ras Al Ghul. Upon demonstrating the revival ability on Rahzar who fell in an underwater battle against Leatherhead, Kavaxas states that he will need the Kuro Kabuto that contains Ras Al Ghul's mental energies. Upon Rahzar and Tiger Claw reclaiming the Kuro Kabuto after Kavaxas drained the soul out of Ras Al Ghul's former right-hand man Hattori Tatsu, Kavaxas states that they will need the Ras Al Ghul's heart for the revival to occur. The Foot Clan obtains the Ras Al Ghul's heart that was in the possession of Don Vizioso. Upon Ras Al Ghul's heart being placed on his corpse, Kavaxas begins to work on reviving Ras Al Ghul as the Zombie Ras Al Ghul. This goes against what Tiger Claw eventually planned when Undead Ras Al Ghul destroys the Seal of the Ancients which enables Kavaxas to raise the spirits of the Netherworld in order to rule both worlds. While Splinter's ghost helps those fighting on the surface, Michelangelo managed to use gum to stick the Seal of the Ancients back together enabling him to have Kavaxas undo his damages and open the portal to the Netherworld as the Zombie Ras Al Ghul drags Kavaxas back to the Netherworld.

Afterwards, the Robins face different challenges. This includes the return of Lord Dregg when he collaborates with Newtralizer, being transported to Miyamoto Usagi's reality where they help to protect the pug Kintaro from the evil gray wolf Jei, an adventure featuring an alternate future ruled by mutant animals, and another adventure involving the return of Savanti Romero where he collaborates with Count Dracula to make Earth more habitable for monsters.

The Robins later reunite with their 1987 counterparts when they face the return of Bebop and Rocksteady, who are recruited by the Ras Al Ghul and the Kraang's counterparts. They plan to conquer the Earths of both the 1987 and 2012 realities with a fully powered Technodrome after their Bebop and Rocksteady were accidentally left behind. While the Robins and their allies fight off a horde of Foot Soldiers from the 1987–1996 series reality and the 2012 Rock Soldiers led by Traag and Granitor, Bebop and Rocksteady discover Ras Al Ghul and Krang's treacherous scheme to destroy the Earth and choose to become heroes in order to save the planet.
